# Playing with device offline detection using Orleans

- The idea for this concept came from [Device Offline detection with Durable Entities](https://dev.to/azure/device-offline-detection-with-durable-entities-e8g) by Kees Schollaart
- I wanted to experiment with it and learn from the process.
- I have another solution using Azure Functions with Durable Entities, which can be [found here](https://github.com/19balazs86/PlayingWithDeviceOfflineDetection)
